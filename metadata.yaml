description: '"This book presents the applications of this newer dynamic psychology
  to the teaching of arithmetic. Its contents are substantially what have been included
  in a course of lectures on the psychology of the elementary school subjects given
  by the author for some years to students of elementary education at Teachers College.
  Many of these former students, now in supervisory charge of elementary schools,
  have urged that these lectures be made available to teachers in general. So they
  are now published in spite of the author''s desire to clarify and reinforce certain
  matters by further researches"--Preface. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA,
